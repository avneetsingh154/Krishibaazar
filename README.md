# 🌾 Crop Sales and MSP Assurance Platform

Welcome to our **Crop Sales and MSP Assurance Platform**! This website is designed to support farmers in selling their crops and ensuring they receive the Minimum Support Price (MSP). Our platform connects farmers directly with corporate buyers, allowing them to sell their crops efficiently.

## Key Features

- **Crop Listing**: Farmers can list their crops on our platform, making them available for purchase by corporate buyers. 📋
- **Quality Assurance**: We use a specialized hardware device to detect and assess the quality of the crops. The quality is evaluated using a machine learning model trained on a comprehensive dataset. 🛠️
- **MSP Assurance**: Farmers are assured of receiving the MSP for their crops, providing financial security and stability. 💰

## UI

Here is a brief overview of the user interface of our platform. You can add screenshots or images of the UI here:
