# Backend Development 🚀

Welcome to the **Backend** folder! This section outlines the development process and roadmap for the backend of our Crop Sales and MSP Assurance Platform. The backend is crucial for handling data storage, processing, and integration with the frontend and machine learning components.

## Overview 📊

The backend will manage various tasks including storing images, quality parameters detected by our hardware device, and other critical information necessary for our platform. The backend will also handle communication with the machine learning model to ensure quality assessments are processed and stored effectively.

## Technologies 🛠️

We will use the following technologies for the backend:

- **Node.js**: For building the server-side application. It allows for efficient handling of asynchronous operations and real-time data processing. 🚀
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js that simplifies routing and server setup. 🗺️
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing images and other data. MongoDB’s flexibility allows us to handle various data types and structures. 🗄️
- **Mongoose**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB, which provides a straightforward schema-based solution to model our data. 📦
- **AWS S3**: For storing and managing images. AWS S3 provides scalable object storage and can be easily integrated with our Node.js application. ☁️
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For user authentication and authorization to ensure secure access to the platform’s data and functionalities. 🔐

## Roadmap 🗂️

Here's a roadmap for developing the backend:

### 1. **Initial Setup** ⚙️
   - Set up the Node.js environment and install necessary dependencies.
   - Initialize a new Node.js project and configure Express.js.
   - Establish a connection to MongoDB and set up Mongoose.

### 2. **Database Design** 🗃️
   - Define schemas for different data types including crops, quality parameters, user profiles, and transaction records.
   - Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing crop listings, quality assessments, and user data.

### 3. **Image Storage Integration** 📸
   - Set up AWS S3 for image storage and configure the Node.js application to handle image uploads and retrieval.
   - Implement endpoints for uploading images and storing metadata in MongoDB.

### 4. **Quality Parameter Integration** ⚙️
   - Develop endpoints for receiving quality parameters from the hardware device.
   - Store these parameters in the database and ensure they are linked to the appropriate crop listings.

### 5. **Machine Learning Model Integration** 🤖
   - Create APIs for communicating with the ML model to fetch quality assessment results.
   - Integrate these results into the data management process to ensure consistency and accuracy.

### 6. **Authentication and Authorization** 🔑
   - Implement JWT-based authentication to manage user access and ensure secure interactions with the platform.
   - Set up role-based access controls to restrict access to sensitive data and functionalities.

### 7. **Testing and Debugging** 🧪
   - Perform testing to ensure the backend functions correctly.
   - Debug and resolve any issues identified during testing.

### 8. **Deployment** 🌐
   - Prepare the backend application for deployment.
   - Use Azure and deploy the backend application.
   - Set up monitoring and logging to track application performance and errors.

## Conclusion 🌟

The backend is a critical component of our platform, providing the necessary infrastructure to handle data and support interactions between the frontend and machine learning model. Following this roadmap will ensure a structured and efficient development process.
