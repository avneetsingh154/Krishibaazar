# Machine Learning Model 🤖

Welcome to the **ML Model** folder! This section outlines our work on developing a machine learning model to predict crop quality based on environmental conditions. We are currently in the process of collecting data and preparing for model development. This README provides an overview of our approach and future steps.

## Overview

Our goal is to build a machine learning model that predicts crop quality using data on temperature, humidity, and moisture levels. The model will help in assessing crop quality more accurately and will be integrated with our hardware setup to provide real-time predictions.

## Current Status

We are currently working on collecting data from [data.world](https://data.world) to build our dataset. This data will include historical records on temperature, humidity, moisture levels, and crop quality. 

## Roadmap 📅

### 1. **Data Collection** 🗃️
   - **Collect Historical Data**: Gather data on temperature, humidity, and moisture levels along with corresponding crop quality.
   - **Include Location and Calamity Records**: Ensure the dataset also includes location information and records of any natural calamities that could impact crop quality.

### 2. **Data Preprocessing** 🧹
   - **Clean the Data**: Handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data consistency.
   - **Encode Categorical Variables**: If there are categorical variables, encode them appropriately.
   - **Normalize/Standardize**: Normalize or standardize numerical features to prepare them for model training.

### 3. **Feature Engineering** 🔧
   - **Create New Features**: Generate new features such as rolling averages or differences over time.
   - **Add Calamity Indicators**: Include a feature for natural calamities occurring during the harvest period.

### 4. **Model Selection** 🧠
   - **Choose ML Algorithms**: For regression tasks, consider algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting. For classification tasks (high or low crop quality), consider Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Support Vector Machine (SVM).

### 5. **Training and Validation** 🔍
   - **Split the Data**: Divide the dataset into training and validation sets.
   - **Train the Model**: Train the model on the training set.
   - **Evaluate Performance**: Assess the model on the validation set using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for regression or accuracy/F1-score for classification.

### 6. **Model Tuning** ⚙️
   - **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize the model’s performance using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search to find the best parameters.

### 7. **Deployment** 🚀
   - **Deploy the Model**: Once trained and validated, deploy the model to receive live inputs from the hardware for temperature, humidity, and moisture levels.
   - **Integrate Additional Data**: Include location information and check for natural calamities in the model’s predictions.

### 8. **Prediction** 🔮
   - **Use the Model for Prediction**: Apply the model to predict crop quality.
   - **Determine Success**: If the predicted crop quality percentage is above 70%, classify the crop as a success.

## Technologies to be Used 💻

- **Python**: Programming language for developing and training the ML model.
- **Scikit-Learn**: A library for implementing machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and data handling.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive development and analysis.
- **TensorFlow or PyTorch**: For more complex models or deep learning (if needed).

## Conclusion 🌟

Developing a robust machine learning model is key to accurately predicting crop quality based on environmental conditions. By following this roadmap, we aim to create a model that integrates seamlessly with our hardware and provides valuable insights for farmers.
