## Sensors and Components Used

Here’s an overview of the sensors and components integrated into our hardware:

### 1. **DHT11** 🌡️
   - **Purpose**: Measures temperature and humidity.
   - **Description**: The DHT11 sensor is used to monitor the environmental conditions around the crops. It provides essential data on temperature and humidity, which are vital for assessing crop health.

### 2. **Soil Moisture Sensor** 💧
   - **Purpose**: Measures soil moisture levels.
   - **Description**: This sensor gauges the moisture content in the soil, which helps in managing irrigation and understanding soil health. Proper moisture levels are critical for optimal crop growth and quality.

### 3. **Liquid Crystal Display (LCD)** 🖥️
   - **Purpose**: Displays real-time sensor data.
   - **Description**: The LCD provides a visual interface for showing data from various sensors. It allows users to view current temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and other critical parameters directly from the hardware.

### 4. **Humidity and Temperature Sensor** 🌡️💧
   - **Purpose**: Measures humidity and temperature.
   - **Description**: This sensor is used alongside the DHT11 to provide additional accuracy and redundancy in monitoring environmental conditions that affect crop quality.
